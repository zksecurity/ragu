//! Staging circuits for multi-stage witness computation.
//!
//! ## Background
//!
//! Circuits are evaluated over witnesses in Ragu by having the prover commit to
//! some polynomial $r(X)$ which [encodes the trace](crate::CircuitExt::trace),
//! and then checking to see if it satisfies the identity
//!
//! $$ \langle \kern-0.5em \langle \kern0.1em \mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r} \circ
//! \mathbf{z^{4n}} + \mathbf{s} + \mathbf{t} \kern0.1em \rangle \kern-0.5em
//! \rangle $$
//!
//! where $\mathbf{r}$ is the coefficient vector for $r(X)$, and $\mathbf{s},
//! \mathbf{t}$ are determined by $y$ and $z$ (respectively) to enforce the
//! gates and constraints (respectively) of the particular
//! circuit. We say that $\mathbf{s}$ is the coefficient vector for $s(X, Y)$ at
//! the restriction $Y = y$.
//!
//! ### Staging
//!
//! However, there are some situations where the prover would like to commit to
//! parts of their witness in one or more **stages**, and _then_ enforce the
//! combination of the stages in the above equation:
//!
//! * The prover may wish to commit to part of their witness first (which may
//!   include hundreds of allocated wires), receive a cryptographic commitment
//!   to that stage, and then apply a hash function to this succinct value to
//!   obtain a challenge value that reduces a claim about the partial trace to
//!   something that can be checked in fewer constraints.
//! * The prover may wish to have multiple circuits contain the same data (but
//!   perform different operations over it) but does not want to pay the cost of
//!   checking equivalence through instance wires.
//!
//! The solution is to decompose $r(X)$ like so:
//!
//! $$ r(X) = a(X) + b(X) + \cdots + f(X) $$
//!
//! where $a(X), b(X), \cdots$ are called _staging polynomials_ (corresponding
//! to a _stage_ of the trace) and $f(X)$ is a special "final" staging
//! polynomial that encodes the "remainder" of the wire assignment for
//! $r(X)$. The prover will commit to $a(X), b(X), \cdots$ independently, and
//! _then_ may commit to $f(X)$ and use instance wires to obtain cryptographic
//! commitments to $a(X), b(X)$ for the purpose of evaluating hash functions
//! that produce digests that are cryptographically bound to their contents.
//!
//! In order for this to work, each of the individual stages (including the
//! final stage) of the trace must be constrained to be well-formed, meaning
//! that their wire assignments cannot overlap. These well-formedness checks
//! use [bonding circuits](crate::BondingObject), whose traces can be folded
//! and checked in a single batched revdot claim.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The [`Stage`] trait allows you to define a **stage** for your multi-stage
//! wiring polynomial. Stages are (currently) designed so that they must be
//! built on top of previous stages, with the trivial `()` implementation for a
//! root stage provided by Ragu.
//!
//! ### Normal Stages
//!
//! [`StageExt::rx`] produces a staging polynomial for a given stage, given a
//! witness. The well-formedness check can be performed by applying a revdot
//! claim between the resulting [`Polynomial`](sparse::Polynomial) and the
//! stage's [staging mask](StageExt::mask).
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let a = MyStage::rx(alpha, my_stage_witness)?;
//!
//! // Register the mask into a registry to obtain s(X, y).
//! let mask_handle = builder.register_bonding(MyStage::mask()?);
//! let registry = builder.finalize()?;
//!
//! let y = Fp::random(&mut rand::rng());
//! assert_eq!(a.revdot(&registry.y(mask_handle, y)), Fp::ZERO);
//! ```
//!
//! If two or more stage polynomials must satisfy the same well-formedness
//! check, they can be combined using a random challenge $z$:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let a = MyStage::rx(alpha_a, my_stage_witness)?;
//! let b = MyStage::rx(alpha_b, my_stage_witness)?;
//!
//! // Sample random challenge z after committing to `a` and `b`
//! let z = Fp::random(&mut rand::rng());
//!
//! let mut combined = a.clone();
//! combined.scale(z);
//! combined.add_assign(&b);
//!
//! let mask_handle = builder.register_bonding(MyStage::mask()?);
//! let registry = builder.finalize()?;
//!
//! let y = Fp::random(&mut rand::rng());
//! assert_eq!(combined.revdot(&registry.y(mask_handle, y)), Fp::ZERO);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Final Stage
//!
//! The [`MultiStageCircuit`] trait implements the overall circuit witness (combining all stages),
//! which is similar to the [`Circuit`] trait. The notable difference is that
//! during witness generation the circuit has access to a [`StageBuilder`] which
//! is used to load stages into the circuit synthesis according to the
//! implementation's hierarchy.
//!
//! Any implementation of [`MultiStageCircuit`] can be transformed into an
//! implementation of [`Circuit`] using the [`MultiStage`] adaptor. The resulting
//! [`StageExt::rx`] output contains the final trace polynomial $f(X)$, which
//! must be similarly checked to be well-formed using the
//! [`StageExt::final_mask`] method's staging mask (obtained from the
//! [`MultiStageCircuit::Last`] implementation).
//!
//! ### Combining the Stages
//!
//! Assuming stages are well-formed, they can be combined by merely adding them
//! together with the final staging polynomial, producing the desired $r(X)$.
