//! Circuit constraint analysis, metrics collection, and routine identity
//! fingerprinting.
//!
//! This module provides constraint system analysis by simulating circuit
//! execution without computing actual values, counting the number of
//! gates and constraints a circuit requires. It simultaneously
//! computes Schwartz–Zippel fingerprints for each routine invocation via the
//! merged [`Counter`] driver, which combines constraint counting with identity
//! evaluation in a single DFS traversal.
//!
//! # Fingerprinting
//!
//! A routine's fingerprint is the tuple `(TypeId(Input), TypeId(Output),
//! eval, num_mul, num_lc)`. The [`TypeId`] pairs cheaply narrow equivalence
//! candidates by type; the constraint counts further partition by shape; the
//! scalar confirms structural equivalence via random evaluation
//! (Schwartz–Zippel).
//!
//! The fingerprint is wrapped in [`RoutineIdentity`], an enum that
//! distinguishes the root circuit body ([`Root`](RoutineIdentity::Root)) from
//! actual routine invocations ([`Routine`](RoutineIdentity::Routine)).
//! `RoutineIdentity` deliberately does **not** implement comparison or hashing
//! traits, forcing callers to explicitly handle the root variant rather than
//! accidentally including it in equivalence maps.
//!
//! The scalar is the routine's $s(X,Y)$ contribution (see
//! [`sxy::eval`](super::wiring::sxy::eval)) evaluated at deterministic
//! pseudorandom points derived from a domain-separated BLAKE2b hash: four
//! independent geometric sequences are assigned to the $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$
//! wires and constraint values are accumulated via Horner's rule. If two routines produce
//! the same fingerprint, they are structurally equivalent with overwhelming
//! probability.
//!
