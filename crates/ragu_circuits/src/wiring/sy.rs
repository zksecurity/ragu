//! Evaluates $s(X, y)$ at fixed $y$.
//!
//! This module provides [`eval`], which computes $s(X, y)$: the wiring
//! polynomial evaluated at a concrete $y$, yielding a univariate polynomial in
//! $X$. See the [parent module][`super`] for background on $s(X, Y)$.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Unlike [`sx`] which can build coefficients incrementally, $s(X, y)$
//! coefficients cannot be computed in a strictly streaming order during
//! synthesis.
//!
//! ### Why Deferred Computation?
//!
//! Consider the coefficient of $X^j$ in $s(X, y)$: it equals $\sum\_{q=0}^{Q-1}
//! \mathbf{U}\_{j,q} \cdot y^q$, where $\mathbf{U}\_{j,q}$ is determined by
//! which wires appear in constraint $q$ and $Q$ is the total constraint count.
//! During synthesis, constraints arrive one at a time—we learn $U\_{j,0}$ from
//! the first constraint, $U\_{j,1}$ from the second, and so on. The complete
//! coefficient of $X^j$ remains unknown until all $q$ constraints have been
//! processed.
//!
//! This contrasts with [`sx`], where each constraint produces a complete
//! coefficient $c\_j$ that can be stored immediately (because the $Y$ powers
//! are symbolic, not evaluated).
//!
//! ### Virtual Wire Algorithm
//!
//! We use **virtual wires** to defer coefficient computation until all
//! constraints are known:
//!
//! 1. **Allocate virtual wires** — When [`Driver::add`] creates a linear
//!    combination, allocate a virtual wire from [`VirtualTable`] to represent
//!    it.
//!
//! 2. **Track references** — Each virtual wire maintains a refcount. Storing a
//!    reference (e.g., in another virtual wire's term list) increments it;
//!    dropping a [`Wire`] handle decrements it.
//!
//! 3. **Resolve on zero refcount** — When a virtual wire's refcount reaches
//!    zero, it *resolves*: distribute its accumulated $y$-power value to all
//!    constituent terms, then recursively free those terms.
//!
//! 4. **Cascading to allocated wires** — Resolution cascades through the
//!    virtual wire graph until reaching allocated wires ($a$, $b$, $c$, $d$), where
//!    values are written directly to the wiring view of the polynomial.
//!
//! ### Wiring View
//!
//! The wiring constraint $\langle\langle r(X), s(X, y) \rangle\rangle = k(y)$
//! uses a "revdot" inner product: coefficients of $r(X)$ are matched against
//! coefficients of $s(X, y)$ in a specific order based on wire type. Rather
//! than building a flat coefficient vector and reinterpreting it, the wiring
//! view provides direct access to the $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ coefficient regions.
//! See [`sparse::View`] for details.
