//! Shared types for wire evaluation during polynomial synthesis.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The [`sx`] and [`sxy`] evaluators compute polynomial coefficients directly
//! as field elements during circuit synthesis. Since both evaluators produce
//! immediate field element results, they can share the same wire representation
//! types defined here.
//!
//! In contrast, [`sy`] requires deferred computation through a virtual wire
//! system with reference counting, because $s(X, y)$ coefficients cannot be
//! computed in streaming order during synthesis (see [`sy`] module
//! documentation).
//!
//! ### Immediate Evaluation
//!
//! Both [`sx`] and [`sxy`] evaluate the wiring polynomial by interpreting
//! circuit synthesis operations directly. Wires become evaluated monomials
//! (field elements) rather than indices, and linear combinations become
//! immediate field arithmetic.
//!
//! ### `ONE` Wire Evaluation
//!
//! The `ONE` wire corresponds to the $b$ wire of the SYSTEM gate, with monomial
//! $x^{2n}$. Since [`Driver::ONE`] must be a compile-time constant, it cannot
//! hold this computed value. Instead, [`WireEval::One`] serves as a sentinel
//! that [`WireEvalSum::add_term`] resolves to the cached $x^{2n}$ value
//! at runtime.
//!
//! [`sx`]: super::sx
//! [`sxy`]: super::sxy
//! [`sy`]: super::sy
//! [`Driver::ONE`]: ragu_core::drivers::Driver::ONE

/// Represents a wire's evaluated monomial during polynomial synthesis.
///
/// In the wiring polynomial $s(X, Y)$, each wire corresponds to a monomial
/// $x^j$ for some exponent $j$. When evaluating $s(x, y)$ at concrete points,
/// wires become field elements rather than indices.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Value(F)` — Holds the evaluated monomial for a wire from [`Driver::mul`],
///   or a linear combination of such evaluations from [`Driver::add`].
///
/// - `One` — Represents the ONE wire. This variant exists because `Driver::ONE`
///   must be a compile-time constant, but the `ONE` wire's actual evaluation
///   (e.g., $x^{2n}$) depends on the evaluation point.
///   [`WireEvalSum::add_term`] resolves `One` to the cached evaluation at
///   runtime.
