//! Partial evaluation of $s(X, Y)$ at a fixed point $X = x$.
//!
//! This module provides [`eval`], which computes $s(x, Y)$: the wiring
//! polynomial evaluated at a concrete $x$, yielding a univariate polynomial in
//! $Y$. See the [parent module][`super`] for background on $s(X, Y)$.
//!
//! The output $s(x, Y) = \sum\_{j} c\_{j} Y^j$ has one coefficient per
//! constraint in the circuit. Each $c\_{j}$ is computed by evaluating a
//! univariate polynomial in $X$ that consists of a linear combination of
//! monomial terms at $X = x$.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Rather than pre-computing $s(X, Y)$ as a bivariate polynomial and then
//! evaluating it (which would require $O(n \cdot q)$ storage), this module uses
//! a specialized [`Driver`] that interprets circuit synthesis operations to
//! produce coefficients directly. Wires become evaluated monomials, and linear
//! combinations become field arithmetic.
//!
//! The driver redefines each operation as follows:
//!
//! - [`gate()`][`DriverTypes::gate`]: Returns wire handles for the $(A, B, C)$
//!   monomials $x^{2n + i}$, $x^{2n - 1 - i}$, $x^{4n - 1 - i}$ at the
//!   $i$-th gate, plus an [`Extra`] token for the $D$-wire monomial $x^{i}$.
//! - [`assign_extra()`][`DriverTypes::assign_extra`]: Converts the [`Extra`]
//!   token into the $D$-wire monomial $x^{i}$.
//! - [`mul()`][`Driver::mul`]: Like [`gate()`][`DriverTypes::gate`] but
//!   discards the [`Extra`]; returns only the $(A, B, C)$ monomials.
//!
//! [`Extra`]: DriverTypes::Extra
//!
//! - [`add()`][`Driver::add`]: Accumulates a linear combination of monomial
//!   evaluations and returns the sum as a virtual wire.
//!
//! - [`enforce_zero()`][`Driver::enforce_zero`]: Evaluates the linear
//!   combination to produce coefficient $c\_{j}$ and advances to the next
//!   constraint.
//!
//! ### Monomial Basis
//!
//! Wires are represented directly as evaluated monomials (field elements),
//! advanced via the running-monomial pattern: at gate $i$ the driver holds
//! $x^{2n+i}$, $x^{2n-1-i}$, and $x^{4n-1-i}$ for $a$, $b$, and $c$. The
//! `ONE` wire evaluates to $1$ (monomial $x^0$).
//!
//! ### Coefficient Order
//!
//! Each [`Driver::enforce_zero`] call writes its coefficient to the next
//! indexed position in the result vector within the current routine's range.
//! Because Horner's rule in [`sxy`] assigns decreasing $Y$-powers to
//! later-emitted constraints (the first emitted gets the highest power), the
//! synthesis-order storage is reversed relative to the canonical polynomial
//! convention where index $j$ is the coefficient of $Y^j$.
//!
//! To reconcile this, [`eval`] reverses each routine's coefficient range after
//! synthesis completes. This per-routine reversal ensures that both this module
//! and [`sxy`] agree on which constraint maps to which $Y$-power.
//!
//! After reversal, the root segment's coefficients are ordered as:
//! 1. $c\_{0}$: `ONE` wire constraint (the constant $1$)
//! 2. $c\_{1}, \ldots, c\_{p}$: public output constraints
//! 3. $c\_{p+1}, \ldots, c\_{p+m}$: circuit-specific constraints
//!
//! This follows from the root segment's synthesis order — circuit body first,
//! then public outputs, and `ONE` last — being flipped by the reversal.
//!
//! The registry key constraint is **not** included in these coefficients; it
//! occupies the fixed $Y^{4n-1}$ slot and is injected at the registry level.
