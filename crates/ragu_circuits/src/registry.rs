//! Management of polynomials that encode large sets of wiring polynomials for
//! efficient querying.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Individual circuits in Ragu are represented by a bivariate polynomial
//! $s_i(X, Y)$. Multiple circuits are used over any particular field throughout
//! Ragu's PCD construction, and so the [`Registry`] structure represents a larger
//! polynomial $m(W, X, Y)$ that interpolates such that $m(\omega^i, X, Y) =
//! s_i(X, Y)$ for some $\omega \in \mathbb{F}$ of sufficiently high $2^k$ order
//! to encode all circuits for both PCD and for application circuits.
//!
//! The [`RegistryBuilder`] structure is used to construct a new [`Registry`] by
//! inserting circuits and performing a [`finalize`](RegistryBuilder::finalize) step
//! to compile the added circuits into a registry polynomial representation that can
//! be efficiently evaluated at different restrictions.

/// generating a proof. In the literature, this is known as
/// [weak Fiat-Shamir attacks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1400).
///
/// To prevent such attacks, one can salt the registry digest $H(m(W, X, Y))$ to
/// the transcript before any prover messages, forcing a fixed instance.
/// However, the registry polynomial $m$ contains the description of a recursive
/// verifier whose logic depends on a transcript salted with the very digest
/// itself, creating a circular dependency.
///
/// Many preprocessing recursive SNARKs avoid this self-reference problem
/// implicitly because the circuit descriptions are encoded in a verification
/// key that is generated ahead of time and carried through public inputs to the
/// recursive verifier. Ragu avoids preprocessing by design, and does not use
/// verification keys, which suggests an alternative solution.
///
/// # Binding a polynomial through its evaluation
///
/// Polynomials of bounded degree are overdetermined by their evaluation at a
/// sufficient number of distinct points. Starting from public constants, we
/// iteratively evaluate $e_i = m(w_i, x_i, y_i)$ where each evaluation point
/// $(w_{i+1}, x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})$ is seeded by hashing the prior evaluation $e_i$.
/// The final evaluation serves as the binding key.
///
/// The number of iterations must exceed the degrees of freedom an adversary
/// could exploit to adaptively modify circuits.
/// See [#78] for the security argument.
///
/// # Break self-reference without preprocessing
///
/// Now with a binding evaluation `e_d`, which is the registry [`Key`], we can
/// break the self-reference more elegantly without preprocessing or reliance on
/// public inputs.
///
/// Concretely, the registry key $k$ is injected as the monomial
/// $k \cdot (XY)^{4n-1}$ at the registry level, binding each circuit's wiring
/// polynomial to the registry polynomial and thus the entire registry polynomial
/// to the Fiat-Shamir transcript without self-reference. The key randomizes the
/// wiring polynomial directly.

/// polynomial evaluations of circuits in the registry.
