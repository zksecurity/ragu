//! Internal circuit abstraction shared by all evaluation drivers.
//!
//! External circuits implement [`Circuit`](crate::Circuit), which hides
//! the SYSTEM gate (gate 0) behind the framework. Internally, the evaluation
//! drivers ([`sx`](crate::wiring::sx), [`sy`](crate::wiring::sy),
//! [`sxy`](crate::wiring::sxy), [`metrics`](crate::metrics)) need to
//! allocate the SYSTEM gate and then run the circuit body. This module
//! provides:
//!
//! - [`RawCircuit`]: like [`Circuit`](crate::Circuit) but called from inside
//!   [`orchestrate`], after the SYSTEM gate has already been allocated.
//! - [`CircuitAdapter`]: wraps any `Circuit` into a `RawCircuit`.
//! - [`orchestrate`]: the shared synthesis sequence that every driver executes.
//!
//! # Orchestration
//!
//! Every driver performs the same sequence around the circuit body:
//!
//! 1. **SYSTEM gate** — Allocate gate 0 with zero placeholder values. The
//!    actual SYSTEM-gate wire values ($d_0 = 1$ as the [`Driver::ONE`] wire,
//!    $a_0 = \alpha$ as the blinding factor) are filled in later by
//!    [`Trace::assemble`](crate::Trace::assemble); evaluator drivers don't
//!    need them filled to compute their results.
//! 2. **Witness** — Run the circuit's [`witness`](RawCircuit::witness) method.
//! 3. **Public outputs** — Write the output gadget to collect
//!    [`Element`](ragu_primitives::Element) wires, then enforce each against
//!    the corresponding coefficient of the instance polynomial $k(Y)$.
//! 4. **ONE constraint** — Enforce that [`Driver::ONE`] equals the constant
//!    term of $k(Y)$. This is the final constraint emitted by synthesis and
//!    occupies the $Y^0$ position.
//!
//! [`Driver::ONE`]: ragu_core::drivers::Driver::ONE
