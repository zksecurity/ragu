//! Internal circuit abstraction with access to the SYSTEM gate wires.
//!
//! External circuits implement [`Circuit`](crate::Circuit), which hides
//! the SYSTEM gate (gate 0) behind the framework. Internally, the evaluation
//! drivers ([`sx`](crate::wiring::sx), [`sy`](crate::wiring::sy),
//! [`sxy`](crate::wiring::sxy), [`metrics`](crate::metrics),
//! [`trace`](crate::trace)) need to allocate the SYSTEM gate and then run
//! the circuit body. This module provides:
//!
//! - [`GateWires`]: a named wrapper for the four wires of a gate allocation.
//! - [`RawCircuit`]: like [`Circuit`](crate::Circuit) but receives the
//!   SYSTEM gate wires, allowing implementations to reference them.
//! - [`CircuitAdapter`]: wraps any `Circuit` into a `RawCircuit` by ignoring
//!   the SYSTEM gate wires.
//! - [`orchestrate`]: the shared synthesis sequence that every driver executes.
//!
//! # Orchestration
//!
//! Every driver performs the same sequence around the circuit body:
//!
//! 1. **SYSTEM gate** — Allocate the SYSTEM gate (gate 0). Its $b$ wire
//!    carries the constant $1$ (the `Driver::ONE` wire) and its $d$ wire
//!    carries the blinding factor $\alpha$. The $a$ and $c$ wires are zero.
//! 2. **Witness** — Run the circuit's [`witness`](RawCircuit::witness) method,
//!    passing the SYSTEM gate wires so that internal implementations (e.g.
//!    [`StageMask`](crate::staging::mask::StageMask)) can reference them.
//! 3. **Public outputs** — Write the output gadget to collect
//!    [`Element`](ragu_primitives::Element) wires, then enforce each against
//!    the corresponding coefficient of the instance polynomial $k(Y)$.
//! 4. **ONE constraint** — Enforce that `Driver::ONE` equals the constant
//!    term of $k(Y)$. This is the final constraint emitted by synthesis and
//!    occupies the $Y^0$ position.
