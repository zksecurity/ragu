//! Native evaluation stage for fuse operations.
//!
//! The prover claims that $f(X)$ is a (low degree) non-rational polynomial in
//! $X$ in order to demonstrate that their claimed queries in the `query` stage
//! were correct. This is achieved by committing to $f(X)$ and then opening it
//! at a random point $u$ (a challenge determined after the commitment to
//! $f(X)$) to its expected evaluation; by the definition of $f(X)$, this is
//! fully determined by quotients involving the claimed evaluations, the
//! evaluations of the various queried polynomials at $u$ and by the various
//! points they were queried at.
//!
//! In order to obtain the real evaluations of the various queried polynomials,
//! the prover will commit to _claims_ about them and these claims are then
//! accumulated together with the claim about $f(u)$.
//!
//! This stage contains the committed claims of all evaluations (other than
//! $f(X)$) at $u$ for all the queried polynomials.
