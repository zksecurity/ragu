//! Unified instance/output interface for internal verification circuits.
//!
//! Internal circuits share a common instance defined by [`Output`]. This avoids
//! redundant evaluations of the instance polynomial $k(Y)$ and simplifies
//! circuit reconfiguration.
//!
//! ## Substitution Attack Prevention
//!
//! Internal circuit outputs are wrapped in [`WithSuffix`] with a zero element.
//! This ensures the linear term of $k(Y)$ is zero, distinguishing internal
//! circuits from application circuits (which never have a zero linear term).
//! This prevents substitution attacks where an application might try to use
//! an internal circuit proof in place of an application circuit proof. Since
//! internal circuits are fixed by the protocol while application circuits
//! vary, this distinction is critical for soundness.
