//! Unified interface for writing cryptographic protocols and arithmetic
//! circuits in Ragu.
//!
//! The fundamental interface of Ragu is [`Driver`], a trait that describes an
//! interpreter or synthesis context for cryptographic protocols. Nearly all
//! protocols in Ragu are implemented in terms of drivers, enabling most of the
//! codebase to share a common execution model.
//!
//! Drivers create wires, assign values, and enforce constraints. They use a
//! [`Maybe<T>`] type (via [`DriverValue`]) to statically gate witness
//! computation, and define their own opaque [`Driver::Wire`] type so that
//! monomorphized code inherits driver-specific optimizations. Drivers can
//! execute circuit synthesis within [routines](crate::routines), which grant
//! them flexibility for parallelization, memoization, and other optimizations
//! via [`WireMap`](crate::convert::WireMap).
//!
//! * **Integration of witness evaluation**: Constraints can be written
//!   alongside witness computation logic, even though drivers tend to reason
//!   about one or the other. To reduce overhead, drivers specify a [`Maybe<T>`]
//!   type (via the type alias [`DriverValue`]) which enables static analysis
//!   and optimization of witness computation for a specific driver context.
//!   This coupling with witness evaluation logic is a zero-cost abstraction.
//! * **Integration of in-circuit and out-of-circuit code**: Recursive proofs
//!   require many algorithms to be executed both within and outside of
//!   circuits, and these implementations must remain consistent for
//!   completeness. The driver abstraction allows these algorithms to be written
//!   once and reused in both contexts with minimal overhead.
//! * **Specialization of wire types**: Drivers define their own (opaque) wire
//!   type [`Driver::Wire`], which users can only clone. Driver-specific wire
//!   types allow simpler implementations of drivers for a wider variety of
//!   contexts. The optimal representation of wires can vary widely: they might
//!   be smart pointers, partial polynomial evaluations, assignment values, or
//!   even just the unit type `()`. Monomorphized circuit synthesis code
//!   inherits memory and performance optimizations from these specializations.
//!
//! ### Routines
//!
//! Drivers can execute circuit synthesis within well-defined abstraction
//! boundaries called [routines](crate::routines). In exchange for a slightly
//! stricter API, users can give drivers flexibility in how circuit synthesis is
//! performed---permitting aggressive parallelization, memoization and other
//! optimizations. Routines use [`WireMap`](crate::convert::WireMap) to
//! translate gadgets from one driver to another during these conversions.
//!
//! See also the [book] for a user-oriented introduction to drivers.

/// A context for executing cryptographic algorithms and synthesizing their

/// Drivers are used to write code that is intended to be synthesized into
/// arithmetic circuits over a field determined by the [`Driver::F`] associated
/// type. Arithmetic circuits are represented in Ragu (equivalently) as a set of
/// wires for gates and a set of constraints placed on
/// their assigned field values to encode addition gates.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// * Wires can be created with the [`mul`](Driver::mul) method. The
///   [`add`](Driver::add) method can create a virtual wire that is defined
///   as a linear combination of some
///   existing wires. The [`constant`](Driver::constant) method is a helper for
///   creating a wire with a constant value.
/// * Wires are assigned values upon their creation; the driver may or may not
///   need to obtain these values depending on whether or not a witness for them
///   is expected.
/// * Users keep track of wire assignments or related witness data using a
///   driver-specific [`DriverValue`] type. This type implements an
///   `Option`-like abstraction called [`Maybe`] which allows for compile-time
///   optimization and static analysis of witness data computation and memory.
/// * Finally, and most importantly, wires can be constrained in two ways:
///     * The [`mul`](Driver::mul) method enforces a multiplicative constraint
///       on the created wires; the wires are the inputs and output of a
///       multiplication gate of an arithmetic circuit.
///     * The [`enforce_zero`](Driver::enforce_zero) method can be used to
///       require that a linear combination of wires equals zero.
///
/// ## `'dr` lifetime
///
/// Drivers are parameterized by a lifetime `'dr`. Routines are constrained to
/// outlive this lifetime so that references to non-`'static` parameters or
/// witness data can be placed inside of them while still allowing drivers to
/// use multithreaded execution. See the [book section on `'dr`][dr-lifetime]
/// for more detail.
///

/// that can be named without binding `'dr`, along with the low-level

/// `ImplWire`) are re-exported here as [`F`](Self::F) and [`Wire`](Self::Wire);
/// others ([`MaybeKind`](DriverTypes::MaybeKind),
/// [`LCadd`](DriverTypes::LCadd), [`LCenforce`](DriverTypes::LCenforce))
/// remain on `DriverTypes` only, since circuit code rarely needs to refer to
/// them. The `gate` method lives on `DriverTypes` because it is an
/// implementor-facing detail—circuit code should call [`mul`](Self::mul)
/// instead. Infrastructure that must name a driver's types without binding
/// `'dr`—see the [`convert`](crate::convert) module—bounds on `DriverTypes`
