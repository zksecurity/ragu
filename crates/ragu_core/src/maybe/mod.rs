//! The [`Maybe<T>`] trait, an [`Option`]-like abstraction that encodes
//! optionality into the type system so that the compiler can perform various
//! optimizations and correctness checks via static analysis.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Optional values are common in Rust, and in `ragu` (like many SNARK
//! frameworks) we wish to express the optional presence of witness data when
//! writing composable and unified circuit abstractions and algorithms.
//! Typically, the witness is present during proof generation and absent during
//! key generation, yet the code paths are shared to ensure consistency,
//! maintainability and readability.
//!
//! However, we almost always _statically_ know whether an `Option<T>`
//! containing witness data is a `None` or a `Some(T)` since the synthesis is
//! monomorphized for a specific backend context. In these cases, an `Option<T>`
//! leads to unnecessary memory usage in contexts where the value is known to
//! not exist. (This is both in terms of the empty, uninitialized value it
//! contains and the discriminant that identifies the variant at runtime.)
//!
//! These overheads are normally negligible, but in `ragu` we very frequently
//! need to perform circuit synthesis (polynomial reductions) without access to
//! a witness. In fact, this process consumes the _vast_ majority of the proof
//! generation time, even after the aggressive optimizations implemented in this
//! library. One of the easiest and most impactful wins would be static analysis
//! of monomorphized circuit synthesis code that proxies an `Option<T>` to a `T`
//! when the value is required to exist and proxies it to a zero-sized type when
//! it is guaranteed _not_ to exist.
//!
//! Rust cannot perform this static analysis with the native `Option<T>` type,
//! and so the [`Maybe<T>`] trait is a higher-kinded abstraction for this
//! purpose. There are further benefits. We now achieve compile-time guarantees
//! about the presence or absence of witness data, and entire classes of bugs
//! and error conditions are eliminated by design. (As an example, `ragu` does
//! not have the concept of a "missing witness" error that can be seen in
//! `halo2`, `bellman`, `arkworks`, etc.) The [`Maybe<T>`] trait also simplifies
//! situations involving _nested_ optionality of witness data, which can be
//! confusing in the context of recursive proofs.
//!
//! See the *Witness Data* chapter in the [book] for the full motivation
//! and design rationale.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! End users typically have access to a [`Maybe<T>`] type that they can treat
//! like an `Option<T>` in many cases: it has [`map`](Maybe::map),
//! [`and_then`](Maybe::and_then) and similar methods. In contexts where the API
//! allows it, the [`Maybe<T>`] can be "unwrapped" to its enclosed `T` value
//! using the [`take`](Maybe::take) method. (In contexts where this is not
//! allowed, a compile-time error _always_ occurs.)
//!
//! It is possible to _create_ a new [`Maybe<T>`] value using the
//! [`just`](Maybe::just) or [`try_just`](Maybe::try_just) methods or another function
//! that proxies to these methods. These methods are provided a closure that is
//! only executed if the concrete type is expected to exist. The compiler
//! dead-code eliminates the closure in all other cases.
//!
//! The actual concrete backing type (and the rebinding) for a [`Maybe<T>`] is
//! determined by its `Kind` associated type that implements [`MaybeKind`].
//! There are only two implementations of this, one for the [`Always`] type and
//! one for the [`Empty`] type. Typically, end users of the [`Maybe<T>`] API
//! will not need to interact with these types or traits or be aware that they
//! exist.
//!
//! There is an additional trait, [`MaybeCast`], that provides the ability to
//! split [`Maybe<T>`] values into multiple values that contain the separate
//! pieces of the enclosed value, or reinterpret the enclosed value somehow.
//! This is done by value in a way that often does not lead to any runtime
//! overhead due to existing memory layout optimizations in the Rust compiler.
