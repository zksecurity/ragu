# The Primitives Standard Library

The [`ragu_primitives`] crate is a **standard library for circuit
developers**. `ragu_core` defines the fundamental `Driver` abstraction
and related traits; `ragu_primitives` builds on that foundation to
provide the concrete gadgets and utilities that most circuit code
depends on:

* **Core gadgets** — [`Element`], [`Boolean`], and [`Point`] provide
  in-circuit representations of field elements, boolean values, and
  elliptic curve points respectively.
* **Cryptographic primitives** — the [Poseidon] sponge hash and
  [`Endoscalar`] challenge gadget for efficient curve arithmetic
  using endomorphisms.
* **Serialization** — the [`Write`][write-trait] trait and [`Buffer`]
  interface standardize how gadgets are serialized to field elements.
* **Containers** — [`FixedVec`] provides a length-typed vector that
  satisfies the `Gadget` trait, ensuring circuit structure is
  determined by types rather than runtime values.
* **Development tooling** — the [`Simulator`] driver executes circuit
  code in-memory for testing and debugging without generating proofs.
* **Gadget utilities** — [demotion and promotion][promotion] for
  stripping and recovering witness data, [consistency
  enforcement][consistent] for enforcing gadget constraints, and
  thread-safe wrappers via [`Sendable`].

The chapters that follow cover individual primitives in detail:

* [**Allocation**](allocation.md) — how gadgets obtain standalone
  wires via the `Allocator` trait.
