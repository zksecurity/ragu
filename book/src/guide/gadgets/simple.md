# Simple Gadgets

## [`Element`][element-gadget]

The simplest gadget is [`Element`][element-gadget], which wraps a wire along
with its known assignment (an arbitrary field element):

```rust
#[derive(Gadget)]
pub struct Element<'dr, D: Driver<'dr>> {
    #[ragu(wire)]
    wire: D::Wire,

    #[ragu(value)]
    value: DriverValue<D, D::F>,
}
```

`Element`s do not guarantee that any particular constraint has been imposed
on the underlying wire. Because wires are the fundamental type of all
arithmetic circuit code, `Element`s are the primitive unit type used for
serialization using the [`Write`][write-trait] trait.

### Allocated Elements

[`Element::alloc`](ragu_primitives::Element::alloc) can be used to create an
`Element` which has an assignment based on witness data. It delegates to
an [`Allocator`](ragu_primitives::Allocator) to obtain the underlying wire.

### Constant Elements

The [`Element::one`](ragu_primitives::Element::one) and
[`Element::zero`](ragu_primitives::Element::zero) methods (and
[`Element::constant`](ragu_primitives::Element::constant) more generally) can
be used to construct `Element`s that represent _constant_ values that cannot
vary in their value depending on witness data.

## [`Boolean`][boolean-gadget]

The [`Boolean`][boolean-gadget] gadget provides a way to interact with wires
that are constrained to be $0$ or $1$ in the field. The logical `AND` of two
booleans can be computed by multiplying two booleans, and given a boolean wire
`a` its logical `NOT` can be obtained with the virtual wire `1 - a`. The
`Boolean` gadget guards the underlying wire (guaranteeing that it is boolean
constrained) and allows it to be manipulated in these ways to produce new
`Boolean` values.

`Boolean`s, like `Element`s, can be allocated or constants. However, they do
not carry instance state indicating whether they are constants (doing so would
violate fungibility). This means that `Boolean` itself cannot be used to
optimize away boolean logic between constants, and so a
non-[`Gadget`][gadget-trait] abstraction must be built to enable these kinds
of optimizations.

## [`FixedVec`][fixedvec-gadget]

Gadgets cannot represent a dynamic number of wires (this would violate
fungibility, since wire count must be type-determined). The
[`FixedVec`][fixedvec-gadget] gadget wraps `Vec<G>` (where `G` is a
[`Gadget`][gadget-trait]) using a statically guaranteed length for the
underlying vector so that [`Gadget`][gadget-trait] can be implemented.
