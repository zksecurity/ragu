# Staging

The simplest circuits in Ragu involve a single trace polynomial $r(X)$ that
commits to the entire execution. However, in several subprotocols of the
construction it is necessary to commit to $r(X)$ in _stages_. As examples:

1. It may be necessary to obtain a verifier challenge inside of a circuit,
   based on values already witnessed by the prover. However, to do this
   safely would require hashing all of the inputs within the circuit, which
   could be prohibitively expensive. **Partial traces are effectively
   Pedersen vector commitments, or collision resistant hashes, of possibly
   hundreds of wires.** Hashing commitments to these partial traces _is_
   feasible and far more efficient.
2. It may be necessary for multiple circuits to operate over the same
   information, but may be prohibitively expensive for that information to
   be communicated via public inputs. If the prover could commit to the
   information partially beforehand, and then separate independent circuits
   could access that information _as though it were part of that circuit's
   witness_, it would also improve efficiency.

In order to support this, Ragu occasionally employs a concept called
**staged traces.** The $r(X)$ of a circuit can be linearly decomposed
into several pieces like so:

$$
r(X) = r'(X) + a(X) + b(X) + \cdots
$$

In this equation, $r(X)$ is the multi-stage trace polynomial with
enforced constraints and gates. However, the prover does not
commit to $r(X)$ but instead commits to the components
$r'(X), a(X), b(X), \cdots$ independently. The polynomial $r'(X)$ can be
called the "final trace" (for a multi-stage circuit) and the polynomials
$a(X), b(X), \cdots$ can be called "stage polynomials."

In order for this to be safe, e.g. $a(X)$ must be linearly independent of
$r'(X), b(X), \cdots$, or in other words $a(X)$ should not contain
allocated wires in locations that would overwrite or become overwritten by
the other terms in the sum $r'(X) + a(X) + b(X) + \cdots$.

In order to enforce this, we use a special "stage mask" that performs a
well-formed check on each of the stage polynomials. The stage mask is
defined by the start and size of the portion of the partial trace that is
reserved for that polynomial; in order to be safe, all wires in $a(X)$
should be set to zero if they are not within this range. The stage mask
simply enforces that everything must be nonzero in this range via simple
constraints.

In order to check that a stage polynomial satisfies this well-formed check,
we perform a revdot claim like so:

$$\revdot{\v{a}}{\v{s}}$$

where $\v{s}$ is the polynomial derived from the stage mask. Notice, this is expressly different from the traditional revdot claim that would be seen in a full circuit evaluation, which takes the form

$$
\revdot{\v{r}}{\v{r} \circ \v{z^{4n}} + \v{s} + \v{t}}
$$

because the stage polynomials must individually only be well-formed, not necessarily satisfy any gates or any non-trivial constraints. Those are enforced on the stage (and the final trace) later in the multi-stage circuit.

Note that two stages that must be enforced in this way can share a revdot claim! That is, enforcing this on $\v{a}$ and $\v{b}$ can be combined using a challenge

$$\revdot{\v{a} + z \v{b}}{\v{s}}$$

because the constraints encoded in $\v{s}$ via the stage mask are
only `enforce_zero` and **there are no public inputs for well-formedness
checks**.
