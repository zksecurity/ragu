## Maybe Values

Explains the `Maybe<T>` abstraction for type-level encoding of optional
witness data, enabling zero-cost optimizations.

## Witness Structure

The prover's witness $\v{r}$ is defined by
$\v{a}, \v{b}, \v{c} \in \F^n$, where $n = 2^k$. Individual elements of
this witness are known as _wires_—specifically, _allocated_ wires, because
the prover must commit to them and thus they exist at a cost. They are
referred to as "wires," rather than "variables," because they principally
behave as inputs and outputs to multiplication gates.

Ragu defines the witness $\v{r}$ as the concatenation
$\v{c} || \v{\hat{b}} || \v{a} || \v{0^n}$, which is an example of a
[structured vector](../protocol/prelim/structured_vectors.md).

### Virtual Wires

The left-hand side of all constraints are linear combinations of
elements within $\v{a}, \v{b}, \v{c}$. Any linear combination of wires can
itself be considered a _virtual_ wire (as opposed to an allocated wire)
which imposes no cost on the protocol.

### `ONE`

Circuits always have the specially-labeled `ONE` wire $\v{c}_0 = 1$. This
is enforced with the
[constraint](../protocol/core/arithmetization.md#constraints)
$\v{c}_0 = \v{k}_0 = 1$.
